# empty-project-template-with-MIT_AKA_X11-License
This is template of project, to present how auto generated by GitHub license file looks like. Using License files looking same like auto generated helps robots to recognize your projects as opensource and recognize license. I highly encourage this practice and thing about LICENSE files as "robots.txt"  file from http world, but for opensource. For more info about licenses : http://choosealicense.com/ , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility and http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html . Other reference for X11 AKA MIT License: http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ .

Remember to fill: [year] [fullname] fields.

When choosing this license consider switching to Apache 2.0 to protect your users against patent treachery or releasing your software on dual license, i.e. both: X11 and Apache 2.0 so user can choose (then I recommend to leave Apache 2.0 in main `LICENSE` file for robots, and X11 in another file, for example `LICENSE.also_X11_aka_MIT`): 

> This is a fine license for a small program. A larger program usually ought to be copyleft; but if you are set on a lax permissive license for one, we recommend the Apache 2.0 license since it protects users from patent treachery.
