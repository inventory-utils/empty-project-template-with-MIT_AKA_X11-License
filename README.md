# empty-project-template-with-MIT_AKA_X11-License
This is template of project, to present how auto generated by GitHub license file looks like. Using License files looking same like auto generated helps robots to recognize your projects as opensource and recognize license. I highly encourage this practice and thing about LICENSE files as "robots.txt"  file from http world, but for opensource. For more info about licenses : http://choosealicense.com/ , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility and http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html . Other reference for X11 AKA MIT License: http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ .
